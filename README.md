# Practice Machine Learning

My own implementation of ML algorithms inspired by different courses and/or books. The main goal is to become familiar with these algorithms by creating a sandbox.

# Components

- kmeans : K-Means. (Lloyd's algorithm with pure numpy)
- knn : K-Nearest Neighbors (pure numpy)
- pcn : Perceptron Neural Network
- mlp : Multi-layers Perceptron
- rbf : Radial Basis Function
- linreg : Linear Regresion

# ToDo:

- Add description to linreg (z-test, p-test, ...)
- Add classifier evaluations (confusion matrix, ...)

# Licence

MIT Licence is used. See the LICENCE file for mode details.
